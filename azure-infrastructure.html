        <p><strong>Azure Infrastructure</strong> stands at the core of digital transformation, enabling organizations to migrate existing applications, accelerate new development, and innovate with advanced technologies like AI. From compute and storage to networking and governance, Azure Infrastructure services offer the flexibility, security, and performance you need to run your workloads in the cloud or hybrid environments.</p>

        <p>When combined with the <strong>Technical Presales and Deployment (TPD)</strong> team’s guidance, you gain a strategic edge: expert insights, tailored best practices, and hands‐on support to <strong>plan</strong>, <strong>build</strong>, <strong>sell</strong>, and <strong>grow</strong> your Azure Infrastructure solutions. Whether you’re moving SAP to the cloud, setting up high‐performance computing (HPC), or simply looking to modernize your datacenter operations, TPD can help you unlock the full potential of Azure Infrastructure.</p>

        <h2>Why Focus on Azure Infrastructure?</h2>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>End‐to‐End Cloud &amp; Hybrid Flexibility</strong><br/>
            Azure’s extensive suite of <strong>Infrastructure‐as‐a‐Service (IaaS)</strong>, <strong>Platform‐as‐a‐Service (PaaS)</strong>, and <strong>hybrid</strong> tools (like <strong>Azure Arc</strong> and <strong>Azure Stack</strong>) ensures you can run virtually any workload—on‐premises, in the cloud, or at the edge.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Unparalleled Security &amp; Compliance</strong><br/>
            From <strong>Network Security Groups</strong> to <strong>Azure Firewall</strong>, <strong>Azure Policy</strong>, and built‐in encryption features, Azure Infrastructure is designed with security at its core—essential for meeting regulatory requirements and safeguarding data.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Performance at Scale</strong><br/>
            Azure’s global footprint and specialized VM families (<strong>N‐Series</strong>, <strong>H‐Series</strong>) enable high‐performance computing scenarios that were once cost‐prohibitive or too complex to manage on‐premises.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Cost Optimization &amp; Governance</strong><br/>
            Tools like <strong>Azure Cost Management</strong>, <strong>Azure Advisor</strong>, and <strong>Azure Resource Manager</strong> help you right‐size resources and maintain financial visibility—all crucial for a successful cloud practice.
          </li>
          <li><strong>Rapid Innovation with AI &amp; Analytics</strong><br/>
            By leveraging the connectivity and integrated services within Azure, you can easily attach advanced AI or data analytics solutions to your infrastructure, delivering insights and unlocking new business models.
