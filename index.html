      <!-- OUR ENGAGEMENT MODEL (with improved spacing) -->
      <section class="section fade-in-up" id="engagement-model">
        <h2>Our Engagement Model: Plan – Build – Sell – Grow</h2>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 2rem;">
          We tailor each engagement according to your needs, following a four-phase approach:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Plan</h3>
        <p><strong>Discovery &amp; Assessment</strong><br/>
        Evaluate your current environment—on-prem, cloud, or hybrid—to identify technical gaps and AI opportunities.
        </p>
        <p><strong>High-Level Architecture</strong><br/>
        Determine the best approach (rehost, refactor, rearchitect, or greenfield) and align solution areas (infrastructure, data, AI) with your business goals.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Roadmap</strong><br/>
        Create a clear project roadmap so all stakeholders understand the project scope, timeline, and desired outcomes.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>
        A mid-sized ISV wants to migrate a legacy .NET app to Azure while integrating AI. After assessing on-prem VMs and databases, we outline a plan to rehost certain components and refactor others for containers, detailing how Azure Cognitive Services can enhance the user experience.
        </p>

        <div class="model-spacer"></div>

        <h3>2. Build</h3>
        <p><strong>Technical Architecture &amp; Deployment</strong><br/>
        Our PTCs guide best practices around networking, security, identity, and data—ensuring a future-proof environment.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Proof-of-Concept &amp; Pilot</strong><br/>
        Validate key workloads, AI prototypes, or performance metrics in a controlled environment before scaling up.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Knowledge Transfer</strong><br/>
        We coach your teams on resource management, DevOps processes, and monitoring so you’re self-sufficient after the engagement.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>
        You modernize a data analytics platform with Azure Synapse, Data Lake, and Power BI. A small proof-of-concept with historical sales data paves the way for full-scale AI-driven forecasting.
        </p>

        <div class="model-spacer"></div>

        <h3>3. Sell</h3>
        <p><strong>Technical Presales Demos</strong><br/>
        Showcase real-world scenarios—like AI-based image recognition—that directly address your customers’ business challenges.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Competitive Positioning &amp; Objection Handling</strong><br/>
        Leverage our deep Microsoft expertise to counter concerns about solution complexity or cost.
        </p>
        <p><strong>ROI/TCO Analysis</strong><br/>
        Develop robust, data-driven business cases to illustrate the benefits of cloud transformation, AI adoption, or workload consolidation.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>
        A partner competes to deploy Microsoft 365 for a global manufacturing client. We help create a Teams + Microsoft 365 Copilot demo that emphasizes streamlined workflow, AI-assisted productivity, and reduced IT overhead.
        </p>

        <div class="model-spacer"></div>

        <h3>4. Grow</h3>
        <p><strong>Post-Deployment Optimization</strong><br/>
        Adopt continuous best practices for performance, scalability, governance, and compliance—crucial for expanding AI workloads.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Advanced Feature Adoption</strong><br/>
        Explore additional services (machine learning, data analytics, IoT) to drive ongoing innovation and revenue growth.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Co-Sell &amp; Marketplace Alignment</strong><br/>
        If you’re a Microsoft partner, we can help align your solution for co-sell and commercial marketplace exposure.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>
        After migrating to Azure, a retailer wants to integrate IoT sensors for predictive maintenance. We help with Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Machine Learning for real-time anomaly detection, turning initial success into a broader advanced solution offering.
