      <!-- WHY TPND MATTERS -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Why TPnD Matters</h2>
        <p>
          In today’s <strong>AI-driven, cloud-first</strong> world, you need more than just product 
          access. You need <em>strategic guidance</em> and a dedicated advisor who can help you 
          navigate complex technical presales, solution design, and rapid deployment. That’s where 
          <strong>Technical Presales and Deployment (TPnD)</strong> shines.
        </p>
        <p>
          TPnD is a global Microsoft organization that empowers partners with the resources, 
          knowledge, and tools to <strong>plan</strong>, <strong>build</strong>, 
          <strong>sell</strong>, and <strong>grow</strong> cutting-edge solutions. Whether it’s 
          modernizing data centers, integrating AI and analytics, or enabling secure remote work, 
          we partner with you every step of the way to accelerate your journey.
        </p>

      <!-- ABOUT US -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>About Us</h2>

        </p>
      </section>

      <!-- CONSOLIDATED CONTENT: PLAN, BUILD, SELL, GROW -->
      <section class="section">
        <h2>Plan</h2>
        <p>
          The <em>Plan</em> phase focuses on discovery, assessment, and establishing a 
          high-level roadmap. We examine your environment—on-premises, cloud, or hybrid—to identify 
          technical gaps and AI opportunities. Together, we determine whether to rehost, refactor, 
          or rearchitect workloads, aligning your technical path with business objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: A mid-sized ISV wants to migrate a legacy .NET application to Azure while 
          integrating AI. After evaluating on-prem VMs and databases, we outline a plan to 
          containerize certain components, incorporate <strong>Azure Cognitive Services</strong> 
          for new AI-driven features, and set up a phased deployment roadmap.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Build</h2>
        <p>
          In the <em>Build</em> phase, our PTCs collaborate with you on 
          <strong>technical architecture &amp; deployment</strong>. We ensure best practices 
          around networking, security, identity, and data storage are followed, while guiding 
          you through proofs of concept to validate performance and AI scenarios. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: You modernize a data platform with <strong>Azure Synapse Analytics</strong>, 
          <strong>Data Lake</strong>, and <strong>Power BI</strong> for real-time insights. 
          A quick proof-of-concept on historical data paves the way for advanced ML-based 
          forecasting, significantly reducing time-to-market for your analytics solutions.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Sell</h2>
        <p>
          The <em>Sell</em> phase focuses on <strong>technical presales</strong>, helping you 
          create effective demos, handle objections, and develop solid ROI/TCO arguments for 
          customers. We can co-create scenario-based demonstrations—integrating AI, cloud-native 
          services, or line-of-business apps—to show how Microsoft solutions address real-world 
          customer challenges.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: A partner competes to deploy Microsoft 365 for a global manufacturing client. 
          We build a custom <strong>Teams + Microsoft 365 Copilot</strong> demo that 
          highlights collaboration, AI-assisted insights, and reduced IT complexity. 
          This ensures the partner can confidently articulate the business value, winning the deal.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="section">
        <h2>Grow</h2>
        <p>
          After success in the field, the <em>Grow</em> phase is about continuous improvement and 
          expansion. We help you identify additional workloads—like <strong>IoT integration</strong>, 
          <strong>machine learning pipelines</strong>, or <strong>co-sell opportunities</strong>—to 
          further enhance your solution portfolio and deepen customer relationships.
        </p>
        <p>
          Example: A retailer successfully migrates to Azure and wants to incorporate IoT sensors 
          for predictive maintenance. We guide the integration of 
          <strong>Azure Stream Analytics</strong> and <strong>Azure Machine Learning</strong>, 
          delivering real-time anomaly detection. This new offering grows revenue streams while 
          cementing the retailer’s trust in your services.

        <article>
          <h3>Financial Services & AI Implementation</h3>
          <p>
            A financial-services ISV wanted to add <em>real-time fraud detection</em> to their 
            existing platform. We collaborated to design a pipeline using 
            <strong>Azure Machine Learning</strong>, <strong>Azure Functions</strong>, and 
            <strong>Event Hubs</strong> for ingesting massive data. The proof-of-concept 
            reduced fraud by 25% in six months, solidifying the partner’s reputation for 
            secure, innovative solutions.

          <h3>Global Manufacturer’s Cloud Migration</h3>
          <p>
            A manufacturer with 400+ VMs on-prem wanted a smooth transition to Azure. We provided 
            a phased migration plan, best practices for hybrid governance, and 
            <strong>Azure Migrate</strong> tooling demos. The result was a 30% reduction in 
            operational costs and higher system reliability—laying the groundwork for AI-driven 
            predictive maintenance later on.
