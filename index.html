      <!-- THE SIX CORE SOLUTION AREAS -->
      <section class="section fade-in-up" id="the-six-core-solution-areas">
        <h2>The Six Core Solution Areas</h2>
        <p>TPnD engagements span all major Microsoft solution domains, enabling you to tackle projects of any scale or scope:</p>

        <h3>Azure Infrastructure</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Modernize legacy servers, enable hybrid scenarios, and deploy container solutions (e.g., Azure Kubernetes Service).</li>
          <li>Implement Azure-native monitoring and governance (Azure Monitor, Azure Policy).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data &amp; AI (Azure)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Modernize data platforms with Azure SQL, Azure Synapse, or Data Lake.</li>
          <li>Implement advanced analytics, machine learning, or cognitive services for intelligent applications.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Digital &amp; App Innovation (Azure)</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Develop cloud-native apps using microservices, serverless architectures, and DevOps.</li>
          <li>Enrich solutions with AI capabilities and publish to the Microsoft commercial marketplace.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Protect identities, endpoints, and data with Microsoft Entra (Azure AD), Microsoft Defender, and Zero Trust architecture.</li>
          <li>Utilize Microsoft Sentinel for AI-assisted threat detection and automated response.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Modern Work</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Deploy Microsoft 365, Teams, SharePoint, and AI-driven tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot to enhance collaboration.</li>
          <li>Establish governance, compliance, and user adoption best practices.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Business Applications</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Elevate customer engagement with Dynamics 365 (Sales, Customer Service, Marketing) and the Power Platform.</li>
          <li>Embed AI for predictive insights and personalized experiences (e.g., Microsoft Sales Copilot).</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <!-- OUR ENGAGEMENT MODEL -->
      <section class="section fade-in-up" id="plan-build-sell-grow">
        <h2>Our Engagement Model: Plan – Build – Sell – Grow</h2>
        <p>We tailor each engagement according to your needs, following a four-phase approach:</p>

        <h3>1. Plan</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Discovery &amp; Assessment</strong><br/>Evaluate your current environment—on-prem, cloud, or hybrid—to identify technical gaps and AI opportunities.</li>
          <li><strong>High-Level Architecture</strong><br/>Determine the best approach (rehost, refactor, rearchitect, or greenfield) and align solution areas (infrastructure, data, AI) with your business goals.</li>
          <li><strong>Roadmap</strong><br/>Create a clear project roadmap so all stakeholders understand the project scope, timeline, and desired outcomes.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>A mid-sized ISV wants to migrate a legacy .NET app to Azure while integrating AI. After assessing on-prem VMs and databases, we outline a plan to rehost certain components and refactor others for containers, detailing how Azure Cognitive Services can enhance the user experience.</p>

        <h3>2. Build</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Technical Architecture &amp; Deployment</strong><br/>Our PTCs guide best practices around networking, security, identity, and data—ensuring a future-proof environment.</li>
          <li><strong>Proof-of-Concept &amp; Pilot</strong><br/>Validate key workloads, AI prototypes, or performance metrics in a controlled environment before scaling up.</li>
          <li><strong>Knowledge Transfer</strong><br/>We coach your teams on resource management, DevOps processes, and monitoring so you’re self-sufficient after the engagement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>You modernize a data analytics platform with Azure Synapse, Data Lake, and Power BI. A small proof-of-concept with historical sales data paves the way for full-scale AI-driven forecasting.</p>

        <h3>3. Sell</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Technical Presales Demos</strong><br/>Showcase real-world scenarios—like AI-based image recognition—that directly address your customers’ business challenges.</li>
          <li><strong>Competitive Positioning &amp; Objection Handling</strong><br/>Leverage our deep Microsoft expertise to counter concerns about solution complexity or cost.</li>
          <li><strong>ROI/TCO Analysis</strong><br/>Develop robust, data-driven business cases to illustrate the benefits of cloud transformation, AI adoption, or workload consolidation.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>A partner competes to deploy Microsoft 365 for a global manufacturing client. We help create a Teams + Microsoft 365 Copilot demo that emphasizes streamlined workflow, AI-assisted productivity, and reduced IT overhead.</p>

        <h3>4. Grow</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Post-Deployment Optimization</strong><br/>Adopt continuous best practices for performance, scalability, governance, and compliance—crucial for expanding AI workloads.</li>
          <li><strong>Advanced Feature Adoption</strong><br/>Explore additional services (machine learning, data analytics, IoT) to drive ongoing innovation and revenue growth.</li>
          <li><strong>Co-Sell &amp; Marketplace Alignment</strong><br/>If you’re a Microsoft partner, we can help align your solution for co-sell and commercial marketplace exposure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>After migrating to Azure, a retailer wants to integrate IoT sensors for predictive maintenance. We help with Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Machine Learning for real-time anomaly detection, turning initial success into a broader advanced solution offering.</p>
      </section>

      <!-- UNDERSTANDING ELIGIBILITY & BENEFITS -->
      <section class="section fade-in-up" id="eligibility-benefits">
        <h2>Understanding Eligibility &amp; Benefits</h2>

        <h3>Eligible Partner Designations</h3>
