      <section class="section fade-in-up" id="engagement-model">
        <h2>Our Engagement Model: Plan – Build – Sell – Grow</h2>
        <p>We tailor each engagement according to your needs, following a four-phase approach:</p>

        <div class="table-container">
          <table class="simple-table two-by-two">
            <tr>
              <td>
                <h3>1. Plan</h3>
                <p><strong>Discovery &amp; Assessment</strong><br/>
                Evaluate your current environment—on-prem, cloud, or hybrid—to identify technical gaps and AI opportunities.</p>
                <p><strong>High-Level Architecture</strong><br/>
                Determine the best approach (rehost, refactor, rearchitect, or greenfield) and align solution areas (infrastructure, data, AI) with your business goals.</p>
                <p><strong>Roadmap</strong><br/>
                Create a clear project roadmap so all stakeholders understand the project scope, timeline, and desired outcomes.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>
                A mid-sized ISV wants to migrate a legacy .NET app to Azure while integrating AI. After assessing on-prem VMs and databases, we outline a plan to rehost certain components and refactor others for containers, detailing how Azure Cognitive Services can enhance the user experience.</p>

                <h3>2. Build</h3>
                <p><strong>Technical Architecture &amp; Deployment</strong><br/>
                Our PTCs guide best practices around networking, security, identity, and data—ensuring a future-proof environment.</p>
                <p><strong>Proof-of-Concept &amp; Pilot</strong><br/>
                Validate key workloads, AI prototypes, or performance metrics in a controlled environment before scaling up.</p>
                <p><strong>Knowledge Transfer</strong><br/>
                We coach your teams on resource management, DevOps processes, and monitoring so you’re self-sufficient after the engagement.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>
                You modernize a data analytics platform with Azure Synapse, Data Lake, and Power BI. A small proof-of-concept with historical sales data paves the way for full-scale AI-driven forecasting.</p>

                Showcase real-world scenarios—like AI-based image recognition—that directly address your customers’ business challenges.</p>
                <p><strong>Competitive Positioning &amp; Objection Handling</strong><br/>
                Leverage our deep Microsoft expertise to counter concerns about solution complexity or cost.</p>
                <p><strong>ROI/TCO Analysis</strong><br/>
                Develop robust, data-driven business cases to illustrate the benefits of cloud transformation, AI adoption, or workload consolidation.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>
                A partner competes to deploy Microsoft 365 for a global manufacturing client. We help create a Teams + Microsoft 365 Copilot demo that emphasizes streamlined workflow, AI-assisted productivity, and reduced IT overhead.</p>

                <p><strong>Post-Deployment Optimization</strong><br/>
                Adopt continuous best practices for performance, scalability, governance, and compliance—crucial for expanding AI workloads.</p>
                <p><strong>Advanced Feature Adoption</strong><br/>
                Explore additional services (machine learning, data analytics, IoT) to drive ongoing innovation and revenue growth.</p>
                <p><strong>Co-Sell &amp; Marketplace Alignment</strong><br/>
                If you’re a Microsoft partner, we can help align your solution for co-sell and commercial marketplace exposure.</p>
                <p><strong>Example</strong><br/>
                After migrating to Azure, a retailer wants to integrate IoT sensors for predictive maintenance. We help with Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Machine Learning for real-time anomaly detection, turning initial success into a broader advanced solution offering.</p>
