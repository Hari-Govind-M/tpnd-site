          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              If you’re part of the Microsoft AI Cloud Partner Program with a Solutions Partner, 
              Legacy Gold/Silver, or Action Pack designation, you likely have TPnD benefits.

          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              It depends on scope. We usually run short, high-impact engagements (a few days to 
              a few weeks) to unblock specific technical or presales challenges.

            <p>
